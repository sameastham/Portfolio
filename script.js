        description: `
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
            At RealTheory, my role evolved quickly from supporting execution to
            <strong>setting product direction and building the design operating system</strong> the company needed to scale. In
            a startup, “UX” isn’t a lane—it’s a lever. I became the person who could turn ambiguity into clarity: aligning
            leaders on what to build next, defining how we’d validate it, and establishing the systems to ship confidently.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem framing and decision-making</h3>
            <p>Instead of starting with UI, I started with questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which user behaviors matter most to the business right now?</li>
                <li>Where are we losing users or momentum?</li>
                <li>What assumptions are we making that we can validate cheaply?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                That approach helped the team prioritize features based on <b>user value + feasibility + measurable outcomes</b>,
                rather than intuition or stakeholder volume.
            </p>

            <h3>Building an insight engine (analytics → strategy)</h3>
            <p>
                To reduce guesswork, I researched analytics platforms and drove the decision to adopt <strong>Pendo</strong>—not as
                a reporting tool, but as a <strong>product decision engine</strong>. I partnered with the team to define meaningful
                events, identify where users struggled or dropped off, and translate that data into focused design and product bets.
                This created a feedback loop where we could observe behavior, form hypotheses, and iterate with intent.
            </p>

            <h3>Systems thinking: design system + collaboration infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
                I also recognized that speed without consistency becomes expensive. I led the move from Sketch to Figma to enable
                shared libraries, faster iteration, and better handoff. More importantly, I built the company’s design system so new
                work didn’t reset quality every sprint. That design system wasn’t “UI polish”—it was governance: reusable patterns,
                interaction standards, and a common language that made the team faster and reduced rework.
            </p>

            <h3>Force multiplier effect</h3>
            <p>
                I facilitated design sessions that kept product, engineering, and stakeholders aligned—especially when tradeoffs
                were unavoidable. My goal wasn’t to “win design arguments”; it was to ensure the team made decisions we could defend
                with evidence, and that our product behavior stayed coherent as we scaled.
            </p>

            <h3>Forward-looking lens</h3>
            <p>
                This experience set the foundation for AI-era product design: building systems that learn, evolve, and stay
                interpretable. The muscle I developed—instrumentation, insight loops, scalable patterns—translates directly into
                <strong>human-AI workflows</strong> where trust, clarity, and iteration speed matter.

        description: `
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>At AT&T, my work matured into full-spectrum product leadership through design. I wasn’t designing “a UI.” I was <strong>creating a shared operational framework</strong> for outage management—aligning multiple teams, roles, and priorities into a system that increased visibility, accountability, and speed of response.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem framing: unify a fragmented ecosystem</h3>
              <p>
                Outage work is inherently cross-functional and high-stakes. The initial challenge wasn’t feature design—it was <strong>system definition</strong>:
                <br />- What is an outage, operationally and technically?
                <br />- What decisions must different roles make, and with what context?
                <br />- Where does information break down across teams?
              </p>
              <p>
                I partnered with stakeholders to map workflows, identify failure points (handoffs, missing context, inconsistent definitions), and define what “success” meant: faster triage, fewer blind spots, clearer ownership, and reduced time lost to searching and reconciling data.
              </p>

              <h3>Systems thinking: architecture before interface</h3>
              <p>
                I owned the <strong>information architecture</strong> to ensure the platform could scale across teams and evolve as requirements changed. That meant designing around:
                <br />- Role-based needs without fragmenting the experience
                <br />- A shared data model and interaction patterns
                <br />- A navigation and search strategy that supports both scanning and deep investigation
              </p>
              <p>
                The result was a cohesive system: outage tracking, duration and assignment visibility, technician notes, global search, customer views, and detailed drilldowns—built as one framework rather than a patchwork of screens.
              </p>

              <h3>Cross-functional leadership: turning competing priorities into product direction</h3>
              <p>
                Enterprise tools are defined by tradeoffs—performance, compliance, operational realities, and stakeholder urgency. I regularly ran alignment conversations where I:
                <br />- clarified constraints,
                <br />- framed decisions in terms of user + business impact,
                <br />- and drove agreement on what we’d ship now vs. later.
              </p>
              <p>
                This work required credibility with engineering and leadership—because the goal wasn’t “design approval,” it was organizational adoption.
              </p>

              <h3>Human-AI interaction: designing trust and interpretability</h3>
              <p>
                The AI summary feature was a key inflection point: it wasn’t about adding AI, it was about <strong>reducing cognitive load without hiding critical detail</strong>. I focused the design around trust-building patterns:
                <br />- clear sourcing (what was summarized),
                <br />- easy access to raw notes,
                <br />- and a workflow that supports verification when stakes are high.
              </p>

              <h3>Measuring impact (insert your metrics)</h3>
              <p>
                This platform was designed to reduce time-to-understand, time-to-triage, and coordination overhead. If you have them, this is where you’d plug in:
                <br />- adoption across teams,
                <br />- reduced mean time to resolution,
                <br />- decreased time spent searching,
                <br />- or reduced escalation volume.
              </p>

              <h3>Forward-looking lens</h3>
              <p>
                Network Outage Manager is exactly the kind of environment where AI maturity will matter most: summarization, anomaly detection, recommendation, and decision support. My experience here positions me to lead <strong>AI-enabled operational platforms</strong> where accuracy, transparency, and workflow integration are non-negotiable.

        subtitle: "Owning a platform that directly impacts workforce transformation (Launch)",
        description: `
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
            At The Home Depot, I moved from designing features to designing <strong>an internal product ecosystem</strong> tied to organizational outcomes: training throughput, retention, and enabling talent mobility. My role became a blend of UX leadership, product strategy, and behavioral analytics.
          </p>

          <h3>Problem framing: design for outcomes, not features</h3>
          <p>
            Launch wasn’t just a tool—it was the backbone of a program that helped employees change careers. That meant success couldn’t be defined as “a smooth experience” alone. We needed to answer:
            <br />- Where do candidates drop out—and why?
            <br />- What does each user type need to move forward confidently?
            <br />- Which operational workflows (attendance, scheduling, approvals) create bottlenecks?
          </p>
          <p>
            I framed the product around program outcomes: reducing friction, increasing completion, and improving clarity for administrators and instructors so the program could scale without breaking.
          </p>

          <h3>Systems thinking: multi-role platform design</h3>
          <p>
            Launch required a role-based architecture that still felt cohesive. I created personas and journeys across students, instructors, and administrators to ensure the system supported different incentives without becoming fragmented. The key was designing rules and workflows that could handle real-world complexity:
            <br />- approvals and scheduling constraints,
            <br />- attendance and accountability,
            <br />- dropouts and edge cases,
            <br />- curriculum access and progression.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytics and experimentation: turning design into measurable improvement</h3>
          <p>
            I implemented analytics to move beyond opinions and into evidence. That allowed us to:
            <br />- identify drop-off points in the application and participation lifecycle,
            <br />- run A/B tests to validate improvements,
            <br />- and prioritize roadmap changes based on measurable behavioral impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helped the team make smarter tradeoffs—investing in what moved outcomes rather than what felt urgent.
          </p>

          <h3>Cross-functional leadership in a lean team</h3>
          <p>
            With a five-person team and me as the sole designer, I became the alignment hub—translating between stakeholders, program operators, and engineering constraints. I led decision-making conversations that balanced:
            <br />- user needs,
            <br />- program realities,
            <br />- and speed-to-delivery.
          </p>

          <h3>Impact (insert your metrics)</h3>
          <p>
            Strong metrics here might include:
            <br />- improved program completion rate,
            <br />- reduced dropout rate at specific steps,
            <br />- increased application conversion,
            <br />- reduced admin time per cohort.
          </p>

          <h3>Forward-looking lens</h3>
          <p>
            My work on Launch prepared me to lead AI-enabled learning and workforce systems—where personalization, guidance, and decision support can improve outcomes, but only if the experience is interpretable, fair, and operationally grounded.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
            At Assurant, my role matured into <strong>portfolio-level systems thinking</strong>. Over six years, I moved from improving a specific internal tool to shaping cross-product UX quality, leading design reviews, and building scalable frameworks for partner-facing experiences.
          </p>

          <h3>Problem framing: unify complexity without oversimplifying reality</h3>
          <p>
            In the Global Warranty initiative, the core challenge wasn’t UI—it was fragmentation. Claims data lived across systems, and employees needed a unified operational view. I focused on:
            <br />- where users lost time,
            <br />- where errors were introduced,
            <br />- and which parts of the workflow created avoidable support load.
          </p>

          <h3>Improving a constrained platform through UX rigor</h3>
          <p>
            Microsoft Dynamics CRM came with serious UI constraints. Instead of accepting those limits, I applied heuristic evaluation and frequent usability testing to identify the highest-cost usability failures—then designed targeted interventions that improved clarity, reduced errors, and increased efficiency for claims-handling teams.
          </p>

          <h3>Product and business strategy: enabling partner scale with white-label infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            A major strategic contribution was creating a white-label framework that allowed phone companies to plug in their design systems while leveraging a common underlying product. That’s not just design—it’s platform strategy:
            <br />- consistency where it drives scale,
            <br />- flexibility where it drives adoption,
            <br />- and governance to prevent divergence.
          </p>

          <h3>Cross-functional leadership and quality elevation</h3>
          <p>
            On the more innovation-focused team, I worked across product, engineering, and research to improve designs through iterative validation. As lead designer, I reviewed other designers’ work, raised usability standards, and helped align teams on principles that improved coherence across products.
          </p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            - reduced handling time per claim,
            <br />- fewer user errors,
            <br />- reduced support tickets,
            <br />- increased partner adoption,
            <br />- faster partner onboarding cycles.
          </p>

          <h3>Forward-looking lens</h3>
          <p>
            This blend—enterprise workflows, partner ecosystems, and scalable design governance—maps directly to AI-era platform design, where systems must evolve without losing trust, consistency, or compliance readiness.

            <h3>Role evolution: from designer to trusted advisor</h3>
              <p>
                In small business environments, you’re not hired for deliverables—you’re hired for decisions. I acted as a strategic partner helping clients clarify:
                <br />- what success meant (signups, leads, conversion),
                <br />- what messaging mattered,
                <br />- and what the simplest experience was that could achieve results.
              </p>

              <h3>Problem framing: conversion as the product</h3>
              <p>
                I approached each project like a funnel:
                <br />- What brings users in?
                <br />- What questions stop them from acting?
                <br />- What friction can we remove without increasing cost?
              </p>
              <p>
                This helped prioritize what truly mattered—clarity, credibility, and next-step momentum—over ornamental complexity.
              </p>

              <h3>Systems thinking at a smaller scale</h3>
              <p>
                Even with simpler sites, I applied scalable thinking: reusable components, consistent interaction patterns, and straightforward content hierarchies that made sites easier to maintain and evolve.
              </p>

              <h3>Forward-looking lens</h3>
              <p>
                This work shaped how I think about product strategy today: constraints are not a limitation—they’re the environment. That’s especially true in AI-enabled products, where you have to ship value fast, learn quickly, and avoid complexity that users can’t understand.

            <h3>Role evolution: ownership from ambiguity to launch</h3>
              <p>
                Freelance requires a different level of leadership: scoping ambiguous problems, setting success criteria, and making tradeoffs explicit. Across projects, I consistently established:
                <br />- the user’s real need (not the initial request),
                <br />- constraints and risks,
                <br />- and a plan to validate direction early.

              <h3>Innovation before the trend: natural-language trip planning</h3>
              <p>
                Designing a natural-language-based trip planning experience before AI was mainstream required anticipating user expectations, building trust, and creating a flow that felt intuitive without modern AI affordances. The key wasn’t novelty—it was reducing planning friction while preserving control and transparency.
              </p>

              <h3>Multi-sided commerce and identity design</h3>
              <p>
                Helping artists sell work or professionals build portfolios meant designing for:
                <br />- trust,

              <p>
                The camp system wasn’t a “website project.” It was an operational platform:
                <br />- intake and onboarding,
                <br />- scheduling and coverage,
                <br />- resource planning for survival constraints (water, food, shifts).
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s workflow design under real consequences—where failure is measurable and immediate. I created a system that improved coordination, reduced confusion, and ensured coverage reliability.
